        <p>Here we have the word <emph>base</emph> used for the first time in the <title>Elements</title>. Proclus explains it (<xref n="Proc. p. 236, 12-15" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">p. 236, 12-15</xref>) as meaning (1), when no side of a triangle has been mentioned before, the side <quote>which is on a level with the sight</quote>
          (<foreign lang="greek">th\n pro\s th=| o)/yei keime/nhn</foreign>), and (2), when two sides have already been mentioned, the third side. Proclus thus avoids the mistake made by some modern editors who explain the term exclusively with reference to the case where two sides have been mentioned before. That this is an error is proved (1) by the occurrence of the term in the enunciations of <ref target="elem.1.37" targOrder="U">I. 37</ref> etc. about triangles on the same base and equal bases, (2) by the application of the same term to the bases of parallelograms in <ref target="elem.1.35" targOrder="U">I. 35</ref> etc. The truth is that the use of the term must have been suggested by the practice of drawing the particular side horizontally, as it were, and the rest of the figure above it. The <emph>base</emph> of a figure was therefore spoken of, primarily, in the same sense as the base of anything <pb n="249" />else, e.g. of a pedestal or column; but when, as in <ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref>, two triangles were compared occupying other than the normal positions which gave rise to the name, and when two sides had been previously mentioned, the base was, as Proclus says, necessarily the third side.</p>

        <p>In an English translation of the enunciation of this proposition it is absolutely necessary, in order to make it intelligible, to insert some words which are not in the Greek. The reason is partly that the Greek enunciation is itself very elliptical, and partly that some words used in it conveyed more meaning than the corresponding words in English do. Particularly is this the case with <foreign lang="greek">ou) sustaqh/sontai e)pi/</foreign> <quote>there shall not be constructed upon,</quote>
          since <foreign lang="greek">suni/stasqai</foreign> is the regular word for constructing a <emph>triangle</emph> in particular. Thus a Greek would easily understahd <foreign lang="greek">sustaqh/sontai e)pi/</foreign> as meaning the construction of two lines <emph>forming a triangle on</emph> a given straight line as base; whereas to <quote>construct two straight lines on a straight line</quote>
          is not in English sufficiently definite unless we explain that they are drawn from the <emph>ends</emph> of the straight line to <emph>meet</emph> at a point. I have had the less hesitation in putting in the words <quote>from its extremities</quote>
          because they are actually used by Euclid in the somewhat similar enunciation of <ref target="elem.1.21" targOrder="U">I. 21</ref>.</p>
        <p>How impossible a literal translation into English is, if it is to convey the meaning of the enunciation intelligibly, will be clear from the following attempt to render literally: <quote>On the same straight line there shall not be constructed two other straight lines equal, each to each, to the same two straight lines, (terminating) at different points on the same side, having the same extremities as the original straight lines</quote>

        <p>The reason why Euclid allowed himself to use, in this enunciation, language apparently so obscure is no doubt that the phraseology was traditional and therefore, vague as it was, had a conventional meaning which the contemporary geometer well understood.

Aristotle is there alluding to the theorem given by Eutocius from Apollonius' <title>Plane Loci</title> to the effect that, if <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> be two fixed points and <emph>M</emph> such a variable point that the ratio of <emph>MH</emph> to <emph>MK</emph> is a given ratio (not one of equality), the locus of <emph>M</emph> is a circle. (For an account of this theorem see note on <ref target="elem.6.3" targOrder="U">VI. 3</ref> below.) Now Aristotle says <quote>The lines drawn up from <emph>H</emph>, <emph>K</emph> in this ratio cannot be constructed to two different points of the semicircle <emph>A</emph></quote>

        <p>If a paraphrase is allowed instead of a translation adhering as closely as possible to the original, Simson's is the best that could be found, since the fact that the straight lines form <emph>triangles</emph> on the same base is really conveyed in the Greek. Simson's enunciation is, <title>Upon the same base</title>, <emph>and on the same side of it</emph>, <emph>there cannot be two triangles that have their sides which are terminated in one extremity of the base equal to one another</emph>, <emph>and likewise those which are terminated at the other extremity</emph>. Th. Taylor (the translator of Proclus) attacks Simson's alteration as <quote>indiscreet</quote>
          and as detracting from the beauty and accuracy of Euclid's enunciation which are enlarged upon by Proclus in his commentary. Yet, when Taylor says <quote>Whatever difficulty learners may find in conceiving this proposition abstractedly is easily removed by its exposition in the figure,</quote>
          he really gives his case away. The fact is that Taylor, always enthusiastic over his author, was nettled by Simson's slighting remarks on Proclus' comments on the proposition. Simson had said, with reference to Proclus' explanation of the bearing of the second part of <ref target="elem.1.5" targOrder="U">I. 5</ref> on <ref target="elem.1.7" targOrder="U">I. 7</ref>, that it was not <quote>worth while <pb n="260" />to relate his trifles at full length,</quote>
          to which Taylor retorts <quote>But Mr Simson was no philosopher; and therefore the greatest part of these Commentaries must be considered by him as trifles, from the want of a philosophic genius to comprehend their meaning, and a taste superior to that of a <emph>mere mathematician</emph>, to discover their beauty and elegance.</quote>

        <p>It is to be observed that, when parallelograms have to be mentioned for the first time, Euclid calls them <quote>parallelogrammic areas</quote>
          or, more exactly, <quote>parallelogram</quote>
          areas (<foreign lang="greek">parallhlo/gramma xwri/a</foreign>). The meaning is simply areas bounded by parallel straight lines with the further limitation placed upon the term by Euclid that only <emph>four-sided</emph> figures are so called, although of course there are certain regular polygons which have opposite sides parallel, and which therefore might be said to be areas bounded by parallel straight lines. We gather from Proclus (<xref n="Proc. p. 393" from="ROOT" to="DITTO" targOrder="U">p. 393</xref>) that the word <quote>parallelogram</quote>
          was first introduced by Euclid, that its use was suggested by <ref target="elem.1.33" targOrder="U">I. 33</ref>, and that the formation of the word <foreign lang="greek">parallhlo/grammos</foreign> (parallel-lined) was analogous to that of <foreign lang="greek">eu)qu/grammos</foreign> (straight-lined or rectilineal).</p>

        <p>If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.</p>

      <div4 type="Proof" org="uniform" sample="complete">
        <p>For in the triangle <emph>ABC</emph> let the square on one side <emph>BC</emph> be equal to the squares on the sides <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>;</p>
        <p>I say that the angle <emph>BAC</emph> is right.</p>
        <p>For let <emph>AD</emph> be drawn from the point <emph>A</emph> at right angles to the straight line <emph>AC</emph>, let <emph>AD</emph> be made equal to <emph>BA</emph>, and let <emph>DC</emph> be joined.</p>
        <p>Since <emph>DA</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>, the square on <emph>DA</emph> is also equal to the square on <emph>AB</emph>. </p>

        <p>But the square on <emph>DC</emph> is equal to the squares on <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>, for the angle <emph>DAC</emph> is right; [<ref target="elem.1.47" targOrder="U">I. 47</ref>] and the square on <emph>BC</emph> is equal to the squares on <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>, for this is the hypothesis; <hi rend="center">therefore the square on <emph>DC</emph> is equal to the square on <emph>BC</emph>, so that the side <emph>DC</emph> is also equal to <emph>BC</emph>.</hi></p>
        <p>And, since <emph>DA</emph> is equal to <emph>AB</emph>, and <emph>AC</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>DA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>BA</emph>, <emph>AC</emph>;</hi> and the base <emph>DC</emph> is equal to the base <emph>BC</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>DAC</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>BAC</emph>.
